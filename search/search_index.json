It provides the lowest level function, as protocol state management, APDU encoding/decoding, APDU encryption/decryption. The library aims to provide a sans-io implementation of the DLMS/COSEM protocol so that the protocol code can be reused with several different io-paradigms. As of now we provide a simple client implementation based on blocking I/O. We have not implemented full support to be able to build a server (meter) emulator. If this is a use-case you need, consider sponsoring the development and contact us. Supported meters # Technically we aim to support any DLMS enabled meter. But since the library is low level DLMS you might need an abstraction layer to support everything in your meter. DLMS/COSEM specifies many different ways of performing tasks on a meter. It is customary that a meter also adheres to a companion standard. In the companion standard it is defined exactly how certain use-cases are to be performed and how data is modeled. Examples of companion standards are: DSMR (Netherlands) IDIS (all Europe) UNI/TS 11291 (Italy) On top of it all your DSO (Distribution Service Operator) might have ordered their meters with extra functionality or reduced functionality from one of the companion standards.

If block is supported in conformance it should be split into blocks and sent. The response should be received and when it is fully received it should be decrypted and returned to the user. By having the \"heavy stuff\" handled in the background it makes it possbile to keep a simple API while adding incfreasing functionallity to the middlestack. We also need to add a certain transport to the client so it can send its data to the meter. HDLC and IP should be implemented. Maybe HDLC_over_IP. But since that is in the IO part it can easily be broken out and extended as needed, supporting asyncio or whatever.

Ex classname: Meter The Meter class holds information on all objects on the meter. By reading the object list of the an association it is possible to get a list of all objects and the access rights on each attribute and method. Even the selective access information is available. But the attribute are different for each interface type and the data you read from them or write to them are different. Many interfaces attributes have a static value. We want the opportunity to predefine the static data so that we automatically can interpret the data returned from the dynamic attributes. For example a profile generic: To be able to interpret the buffer we need to know the captured_object. To be able to interpret the values in the buffer we need to look up the object (ic=DATA just holds a value, ic=Register holds a dynamic value and static information about the scalar and the unit.) So we want a way to read the current assosiation list For every instance object we would like to read all the static information. This should then be outputted into a file. yaml for humans or json for machines. By supplying the file to the Meter class it is possible to call instances and get values back.

It specifies an object-oriented data model, an application layer protocol and media-specific communication profiles. DLMS/COSEM comprises three key components: DLMS # Device Language Message Specification - the application layer protocol that turns the information held by COSEM objects into messages. DLMS/COSEM can be used for all utilities / energy kinds, all market segments, all applications and over virtually any communication media. COSEM # Companion Specification for Energy Metering - the object model capable of describing virtually any application. OBIS # Object Identification System, the naming system of the objects COSEM (Companion Specification for Energy Metering) # The COSEM object model describes the semantics of the language. COSEM interface classes and their instantiations (objects) can be readily used for modelling metering use cases, yet general enough to model any application. Object modelling is a powerful tool to formally represent simple or complex data. Each aspect of the data is modelled with an attribute. Objects may have several attributes and also methods to perform operations on the attributes. Objects can be used in combinations, to model simple use cases such as register reading or more complex ones such as tariff and billing schemes or load management. OBIS (Object Identification System) # OBIS is the naming system of COSEM objects. OBIS codes are specified for electricity, gas, water, heat cost allocators (HCAs) and thermal energy metering, as well as for abstract data that are not related to the energy kind measured. The hierarchical structure of OBIS allows classifying the characteristics of the data e.g. electrical energy \u2013 active power \u2013 integration \u2013 tariff \u2013 billing period. DLMS /COSEM application layer services # DLMS stands for Device Language Message Specification The syntax of the language is specified by the DLMS services. DLMS/COSEM uses a client-server model where the end devices, typically meters are the servers and the Head End Systems are the clients. The DLMS/COSEM application layer provides: the ACSE services to connect the clients and the servers. the xDLMS services to access the data held by the COSEM objects. The xDLMS services are the same for each object; this allows new objects to be added to the model without affecting the application layer. The application layer also builds the messages (APDUs, Application Protocol Data Units), applies, check and removes cryptographic protection as needed and manages transferring long messages in blocks. The messages can transported over virtually any communication media. There are various built-in mechanisms available for optimizing the traffic to the characteristics of the media. Transport # The application messages can be transported over virtually any communication media. The DLMS/COSEM communication profiles specify, for each communication the protocol stack and the binding of the lower protocol layers to the DLMS/COSEM application layer. Communication profiles are available for: Local ports, PSTN/GSM: with HDLC data link layer RS232 / RS485; GPRS/LTE/NB-IoT; IPv6, IPv4, TCP and UDP; S-FSK PLC; G3-PLC with UDP/ IPv6; Prime PLC without IP, with IPv6, IPv4, TCP and UDP; Wired and wireless M-Bus; Mesh networks with IPv6 and 6LowPAN; Wi-SUN LoRaWAN","title":"About DLMS/COSEM"},{"location":"dlms_cosem/#about-dlmscosem","text":"DLMS/COSEM (IEC 62056, EN13757-1) is the global standard for smart energy metering, control and management.

COSEM interface classes and their instantiations (objects) can be readily used for modelling metering use cases, yet general enough to model any application. Object modelling is a powerful tool to formally represent simple or complex data. Each aspect of the data is modelled with an attribute. Objects may have several attributes and also methods to perform operations on the attributes. Objects can be used in combinations, to model simple use cases such as register reading or more complex ones such as tariff and billing schemes or load management.","title":"COSEM  (Companion Specification for Energy Metering)"},{"location":"dlms_cosem/#obis-object-identification-system","text":"OBIS is the naming system of COSEM objects. OBIS codes are specified for electricity, gas, water, heat cost allocators (HCAs) and thermal energy metering, as well as for abstract data that are not related to the energy kind measured. The hierarchical structure of OBIS allows classifying the characteristics of the data e.g. electrical energy \u2013 active power \u2013 integration \u2013 tariff \u2013 billing period.","title":"OBIS  (Object Identification System)"},{"location":"dlms_cosem/#dlms-cosem-application-layer-services","text":"DLMS stands for Device Language Message Specification The syntax of the language is specified by the DLMS services. DLMS/COSEM uses a client-server model where the end devices, typically meters are the servers and the Head End Systems are the clients. The DLMS/COSEM application layer provides: the ACSE services to connect the clients and the servers. the xDLMS services to access the data held by the COSEM objects. The xDLMS services are the same for each object; this allows new objects to be added to the model without affecting the application layer. The application layer also builds the messages (APDUs, Application Protocol Data Units), applies, check and removes cryptographic protection as needed and manages transferring long messages in blocks. The messages can transported over virtually any communication media. There are various built-in mechanisms available for optimizing the traffic to the characteristics of the media.","title":"DLMS /COSEM application layer services"},{"location":"dlms_cosem/#transport","text":"The application messages can be transported over virtually any communication media. The DLMS/COSEM communication profiles specify, for each communication the protocol stack and the binding of the lower protocol layers to the DLMS/COSEM application layer.
